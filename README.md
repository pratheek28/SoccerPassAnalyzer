# âš½ Soccer Passing Network Visualizer

This project builds an **interactive soccer passing network** using [StatsBomb open-data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data).  
It lets you visualize how players connect with each other on the pitch, filter by match time, and explore the passing structure of a team.
